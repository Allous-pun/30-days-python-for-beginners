## Tuples

A tuple is a collection of different data types which is ordered and unchangeable (immutable). Tuples are written with round brackets, (). Once a tuple is created, we cannot change its values. We cannot use add, insert, remove methods in a tuple because it is not modifiable (mutable). Unlike list, tuple has few methods. Methods related to tuples:

- tuple(): to create an empty tuple
- count(): to count the number of a specified item in a tuple
- index(): to find the index of a specified item in a tuple
- + operator: to join two or more tuples and to create a new tuple

### Creating a Tuple

- Empty tuple: Creating an empty tuple
  
  ```py
  # syntax
  empty_tuple = ()
  # or using the tuple constructor
  empty_tuple = tuple()
  ```

- Tuple with initial values
  
  ```py
  # syntax
  tpl = ('item1', 'item2','item3')
  ```

  ```py
  fruits = ('banana', 'orange', 'mango', 'lemon')
  ```

### Tuple length

We use the _len()_ method to get the length of a tuple.

```py
# syntax
tpl = ('item1', 'item2', 'item3')
len(tpl)
```
